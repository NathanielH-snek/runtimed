# `jupyter-serde`

These are shared data structures between `nbformat` and `jupyter-protocol`. This package isn't intended to be used standalone, but rather as a dependency of other crates.

You may want either one of those crates if you're wanting to work with notebook documents, directly with kernels, or both.
