//! Provides utilities for managing execution counts in Jupyter sessions.
//!
//! This module defines the `ExecutionCount` type, which represents a monotonically
//! increasing counter for tracking the number of code executions in a Jupyter session.
//! This count is not tied to individual cells but represents the overall execution history
//! of the session, including code run via `execute_request` in terminals.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use jupyter_protocol::ExecutionCount;
//!
//! // Start a new session
//! let mut count = ExecutionCount::new(1);
//! assert_eq!(count.value(), 1);
//!
//! // After executing some code
//! count.increment();
//! assert_eq!(count.value(), 2);
//!
//! // Creating from a known execution count
//! let count_from_usize: ExecutionCount = 3.into();
//! assert_eq!(count_from_usize.value(), 3);
//!
//! // Converting back to usize
//! let usize_from_count: usize = count.into();
//! assert_eq!(usize_from_count, 2);
